  <h1>Element Content</h1>
  <!-- * Element contains an opening tag, some content and a closing tag -->

  <br />
  <!-- * Some Elements don't contain content and a closing/end tag, these element are called Empty Element. -->

  <!-- ? Difference between element and tag
    * Tag is a part of syntax that marks start and end of element
    * Tag may be a opening tag <h1> or may be a closing tag </h1> (two tags)
    * Tag don't contain content
    * Element is a combination of start tag , content and end tag
    * Empty tag like <br/> are complete without content and don't contain closing tag so it is also an element

    <h1>Nested Element</h1>
  </div>
  <!-- Elements can be nested in other elements  -->
  <!-- Tag names are case insensitive mean <P> or </p> are same but W3C standard recommends us to use lowercase  -->
