<!-- You can use .htm and .html extension to create html file both are same -->

<!DOCTYPE html> 

<!-- 
  * It represent document type (or version html5/ html4 ...) and help browsers to display content correctly
  * It Should appear only one time in html page
  * It is case insensitive (doctype , DOCTYPE, docType is same) usually written upper case 
  * <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is for html 5
-->

<html> 
<!-- * HTML Document starts with html tag or it is starting point of html document-->

<head>
<!--
  * All meta data is written inside head tag
  * It contains content for web browser or for SEO
  * Its content is not visible in browser
-->
</head>

<body>
<!-- * All visible part of html document is written in body tag -->

<h1>Element Content</h1>
<!-- * Element contains an opening tag, some content and a closing tag -->

<br />
<!-- * Some Elements don't contain content and a closing/end tag, these element are called Empty Element. -->

<!-- ? Difference between element and tag
  * Tag is a part of syntax that marks start and end of element
  * Tag may be a opening tag <h1> or may be a closing tag </h1> (two tags)
  * Tag don't contain content
  * Element is a combination of start tag , content and end tag
  * Empty tag like <br/> are complete without content and don't contain closing tag so it is also an element
